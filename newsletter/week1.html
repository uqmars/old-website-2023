                <h1>UQ Mars Newsletter - Week 1</h1>
        
                <p>
                  Welcome to all our new members! Whether you've had the chance to meet our exec at market day or the Brisbane Tech Clubs Summer BBQ, or are still to make it to an event, we look forward to getting to know everyone throughout the year. 
                  <br><br>
                  And to our MARS veterans, we've missed you like a robot misses the good old days of punch cards and vacuum tubes.
                  <br><br>
                  We've been working hard to make UQ MARS bigger and better than ever before. Our robot army has grown exponentially, and we're ready to take over the world... or at least win some competitions! 
                  <br><br>
                  Get ready for some electrifying workshops that will shock your circuits and leave you buzzing with excitement. We've got some truly 'out of this world' ideas for the upcoming robotics competitions that we can't wait to share with you. So, strap on your thinking caps, oil your joints, and get ready to blast off into another stellar year with UQ MARS. It's going to be a wild ride, and we're so excited to have you all on board! 
                  <br><br>  
                  Please find our upcoming events below, as well as our new project shout-out section. If you have a cool project going on, we'd love to feature you in our next shoutout - shoot us an email or DM our socials!

                      Raghav will be talking about how we can use specialised computer hardware, 
                      especially GPUs that are common in gaming, to speed up how robots perceive 
                      and plan in the world efficiently.<br><br>
                      He will be briefly introducing:<br>
                      - CPU vs specialised hardware<br>
                      - GPUs and parallel execution<br>
                      - The current hardware options (Intel/NVIDIA/AMD GPUs, FPGAs) and the software 
                      scene (CUDA, OpenCL, SYCL)<br>
                      - Examples of how simple hardware accelerated code can be written<br>
                      - How you could get start off and get involved<br>
                      There's no prerequisites to understanding the talk! 
                      It would be beneficial to have some knowledge of basic
                       computer hardware and simple C programming, but Raghav will explain everything.<br>

                            I graduated from Marist College Ashgrove last year and I love robotics and enjoy building and flying RC planes. 
                            I’ve competed in a few competitions, including the UAV challenge where my team placed third and 
                            received the innovation award for being the first team to use computer vision to identify the target as well 
                            as the RoboCup competition where we also placed third in the micromouse inspired division. To help with my 
                            projects, I turned my bedroom int an electronics test lab, complete with almost everything you could need, 
                            I’m just missing a vector network analyser!
                            <br> <br>

                            For the last couple of years, I’ve been working on developing a quadrupedal robot, loosely based on 
                            Boston Dynamics’ Spot. I severely misjudged the complexity of the problem, resulting in 7 major 
                            hardware iterations (soon to be 8) and with each attempt getting progressively better but just 
                            falling short. I wanted to make it more advanced than just using 12 servos, however, using brushless motors with field-oriented control was far too expensive. The cost of the project has been the single largest limiting factor; I wanted to keep it less than $500 (working at Jaycar with the staff discount definitely helps!). This made a difficult problem much harder and has forced me to develop my own actuators and motor controllers. The end goal is to be able to have it walk around autonomously and map its environment. I’ve learned so much about software, electrical and mechanical design with this project and I’m really excited to be part of MARS and collaborate with other likeminded people!
                            Fun fact: I once built a 4-meter-long wind tunnel under my house to collect data about the airfoils for my RC planes.

                <h2>Our Subject Guide</h2>
                <p>
                  We are currently developing a comprehensive course guide to aid students in the selection of their courses. 
                  The guide will present suggested program structures, enrolment plans, course profiles, 
                  and offer the chance to inform students of the specific pathways available within Mechatronics and 
                  adjacent specialisations such as Electrical/Computer Engineering. We will aim to give specialised 
                  advice from our Exec team and various UQ MARS Alumni regarding study advice, course selection and 
                  general career advice.
                  <br><br>
                  Please note that the course guide is currently a work in progess. Check it out using the button below.
