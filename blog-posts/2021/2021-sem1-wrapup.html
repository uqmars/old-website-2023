              Throughout the first half of 2021, UQ MARS had the opportunity to

              presenters were invited to speak to our members about their latest
              projects and provide an insight into robotics and its related
              fields in industry.

                Pounds</b
              ><br /><br />

              Our first guest speaker for the semester was Dr Pauline Pounds, a
              Mechatronics researcher at UQ with a quite possibly fanatical
              interest in drones, robots, and Star Wars. Pauline’s talk
              “Gyroscopic Bipeds – A Different Way of Walking” took students on
              a tour of the history of walking robots. She provided a deep dive
              into the science behind her Tiny Giant Robot, a bipedal robot that
              Pauline and her lab group have been working on for several years
              now (including 2020 President, Cameron Stroud, and 2020/2021
              Technical Officer, Anastasia Laczko).

            </p>

            <p>
              Pauline’s talk touched on her early research career, which largely
              focused on aerial robotics. As well as how recent years have drawn
              her focus towards bipedal robots – partly due to being inspired by
              the insanely cool robots from Star Wars. Pauline discussed many of
              the complex engineering challenges that bipedal robots pose
              compared to wheeled robots and quadrupeds, and how a background in
              drones has helped her to tackle them.

                “Bipeds are much more challenging to build and that makes them
                much more interesting. They have to balance, they have to stand
                up right, they’re unstable and their actuation and sensing
                requirements are extreme.” – Pauline

              ><br /><br />

              Following Pauline’s talk, UQ MARS had the pleasure of
              collaborating with UQ Biotech, MESS, UQ AIML and UQ Pain as part
              of an industry seminar with the globally-renowned NASA. Dr Ravi
              Margasahayam, a systems engineer and launch pad expert, gave an
              insight into his journey through the aerospace industry. Dr
              Margasahayam spoke to the collective societies about his passion
              for engineering, and his journey from his humble beginnings to
              become one of the world’s leading experts in System Engineering.
              As he put it, his career has taken him “from the Gateway of India
              to the Gateway of the Universe”. It was an eye-opening perspective
              for the many students in the audience, with a speech that really
              highlighted that anything is possible if you put passion and
              effort into your work. A massive takeaway for UQ MARS was the
              insight Dr Margasahayam gave into higher level engineering design.

              Given his speciality in vibroacoustics, we were delighted when he
              showed us a snippet of some of his work in the field, giving
              examples from rollout fatigue tests that are used to determine if
              vibration is a critical cause of failure in launch pad
              engineering. He then concluded with a summary of the NASA Kennedy
              Space Centre, as well as a perspective of what it is like to work
              there.  UQ MARS would like to thank both Dr Margasahayam and NASA
              for the presentation, and UQ Biotech for organising the talk.

              <b>Electronics Design: An Industry Insight with Scott Williams</b
              ><br /><br />

              The final guest speaker for the semester was Scott Williams, an
              electronics design engineer and the founder of Xentronics, a PCB
              consultancy based in Melbourne. As UQ MARS had given a beginner’s
              PCB workshop earlier in the semester, we were thrilled to hear he
              had accepted our invite to finish the workshop and give insight
              into what it’s like to design PCBs in industry. Scott provided our
              members with some context about the types of roles within the
              electronics design industry. He then explained how the design
              process worked in a professional setting, covering everything from
              prototyping to design verification, and the legal complexities of
              complying with government electronics regulations. The audience
              was also incredibly eager to learn from his Altium design tips,
              which gave us some solutions to problems that most of us had never
              even considered while designing a PCB!

            <p>
              The talk closed with the opportunity to see some of the PCBs Scott
              has personally designed firsthand. It was really awesome to see
              how many of the tips he had shown us were considered and
              implemented in his own electronics design, and the final products
              undoubtedly inspired many of the future electronics design
              engineers in the audience. It was a pleasure to have Scott as a
              guest speaker, and UQ MARS would love to see him involved in the
              future!
